# ðŸš€ Course Overview

## Welcome to Fundamentals!

Coding Fundamentals is Rocket Academy's intro course in software programming, also known as coding. You will learn basic coding syntax and concepts through building simple programs. Students interested in software engineering careers can continue with Rocket's [Coding Bootcamp](https://www.rocketacademy.co/courses/bootcamp-course) after Fundamentals to build more complex applications and start on a career as a software engineering.

If you are interested in understanding what is required to attend our Bootcamp, please refer to the [Bootcamp Admission Criteria page](course-logistics/post-course/bootcamp-admission-criteria.md).

### What is Fundamentals About?

Coding Fundamentals aims to introduce the elements of constructing a program and thinking about how it should work in a short amount of time. This happens in a "sandbox" JavaScript environment meant to focus on the universal, fundamental concepts of programming, rather than being specific to the JavaScript language. Using project and mastery based learning it aims to incrementally level-up students' coding knowledge through fun game-based mini projects.

Ultimately, this is a tool to allow students to understand if they truly enjoy software engineering, and to serve as a tool that would allow one to make a better decision towards whether or not to further pursue a software engineering career.

### What is Fundamentals Not?

Fundamentals is focused on project-based learning, so does not cover theoretical computer science concepts. It is focused on universal programming fundamentals, so does not cover software systems or code frameworks as they are deployed in a commercial setting.
