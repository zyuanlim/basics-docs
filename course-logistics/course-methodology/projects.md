## Project Presentations and Review

Students present projects in class on the last day of each project. Presentations should cover the following.

1. Demo
2. Biggest challenges faced
3. What they might do differently next time

In order to keep each presentation relatively brief, the presentation should be focused around the _features_ of the game. The presentation is not a code review, as that would take up too much time.

## Code Review

On days when projects are due, we will review each others' code in groups of 2 or 3 during class. If there is a group of 3, the triplet will do individual code review together so that everyone gets to review someone else's code, then split into 2 groups for pairing.

### Individual Review

#### 1) Clone Partner's Code

You'll be paired up so that you can exchange the links for your repos via Slack. Remember that the forked repo is the one that is under your GitHub account, not Rocket Academy's. If you have forked the repo but haven't pushed your latest code to GitHub, take a moment now to `git push`. Let your partner know you're updating the repo. Run a `git clone <REPO_URL> <NEW_FOLDER_NAME>` to get a copy of your partner's code.

Note: You need to rename the folder when you clone if you already have a folder named after the repo where you're making the clone.
{% endhint %}

#### 2) Run Partner's Code

Open the code in the browser and test it. What does it do? If you're not sure what it does look inside `script.js` to see.

#### 3) Read Partner's Code

Read the code and answer the following questions.

1. How does it work?
2. Does it have any obvious errors?
3. Does it implement something that you were trying to do?
4. Does it implement a feature that you haven't started yet? How does the code work?

#### 4) Play with Partner's Code

It may be helpful to make changes to the code to help you understand it better. Write some `console.log` that would help you figure out what the code does. Break the code in a certain way to prove how it works or doesn't work.

#### 5) Discuss

Once both partners are done with #1-4, discuss what you saw.

### Peer Review

You'll be pair programming on one person's project at a time. The goal is to get working versions for each person. **The driver will be the person who is \*not\* working on their own code.**&#x20;

Once done with one person's code, send the code to your pair (it's their project) via a [Slack code snippet](https://slack.com/intl/en-sg/slack-tips/share-code-snippets). Switch to work on the other person's code.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: If you are working on your partner's code you can't push to their repo because GitHub repos are read-only to non-owners by default.
{% endhint %}

If you both have working versions, implement a new feature in one of the projects together.
