# 🏫 Course Methodology

## Class Organization

Each cohort will be split into sections of no more than 20 students. Each section will be led by a section leader from Rocket, who will be the primary point of contact for that section during SWE Fundamentals. Sections are assigned randomly and fixed for the duration of the course. Students will meet with their respective sections for classes to maximise interaction and learning. Students will be able to interact with students from other sections via Slack.
