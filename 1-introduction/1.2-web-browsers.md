# 1.2: Web Browsers

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lessons, you should be able to:

- Explain what a web browser is in your own words.
- Explain what role browsers play in this course, and why we use them.
- Make simple edits to a HTML file and see those changes reflected in your browser.

## Web Browser History

The World Wide Web and web browsers were born in 1990 when Tim Berners-Lee invented a way to view HTML documents through the Internet.

## What is a Web browser?

A web browser is a program used to view and interact with web pages. A web browser is a purpose-built application; just like Windows Media Player or iTunes are built to handle audio or video files, web browsers are built to handle HTML and related files.

A web browser is used to _browse_ for files on the _web._ If we abstract "the web" as just computers connected together, a browser fundamentally browses files on computers. You can browse files on your own computer by typing `C://` or `file://` in the browser navigation bar for Windows and MacOS, respectively.

When you visit YouTube to watch a video, you are _browsing_ to a connected computer which has the video you want saved into memory.

### Why learn about web browsers?

In Coding Fundamentals we will use browsers as a learning tool to visualize inputs and outputs of our code through web pages. **In general, web browsers are not necessary for writing and executing code.**

## HTML

We will very briefly touch on HTML and what how web browsers process them, and dive deeper into HTML later on.

HTML stands for HyperText _Markup_ Language. An HTML file is simply a text file, you can open HTML files with notepad or other simple text-processing applications. Markup means that the text is presented to the user as more than just plain text: it involves structure and formatting. Almost all websites are rendered using HTML. Browsers were invented to download and render HTML on computers. HTML is **not** a programming language, but it can easily work with JavaScript, which is a programming language.

The programs we will build in Coding Fundamentals will rely on HTML to accept inputs and visualize outputs. The programs we will build will be written in JavaScript.

## Exercises

### Run Starter Code in Browser

1. Download a compressed ZIP file from [this link](https://github.com/rocketacademy/swe101-starter-code/archive/main.zip).
2. If you haven't already, create a `fundamentals`folder in a local folder, e.g. `Documents`.
3. Move the downloaded .zip file to the `fundamentals` folder.
4. Unzip the file - it should create a new `fundamentals-starter-code` folder. The starter code files are in this folder.
5. Open the `index.html` file in Chrome. Double click it if Chrome is your default browser. Or, you can right click to open in Chrome.

### Change HTML Text on Page

1. Change the text of the button on line `72`. Again save and refresh the page in Chrome, and notice how the button text changes.
2. Change the word `Fundamentals!` on line `62` to something else. Save the file and refresh the opened `index.html` file in Chrome. Notice how the text changes.
3. Open the `fundamentals` folder in VS Code. We can open the whole folder instead of a specific file, which will allow us to open multiple files within that folder easily. In the left sidebar of VS Code, select the file `fundamentals-starter-code/index.html` to open it. See video above for an example.
