## JavaScript with DOM

Khan Academy has a good set of follow-on lessons that will dovetail with the DOM material we covered here in [10.2](../10-advanced/10.3-browser-applications-with-dom.md) and [11](pce-dom.md).

## Javascript Programming

Khan Academy also has some fun lessons that are more focused around programming concepts and fun things to build.

## Computer Science Fundamentals

For a broader Computer Science overview of the field, **Harvard's CS50** is a good choice. This course is quite a bit more difficult than Fundamentals and uses the C programming language, among others.

You can take the course through a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) at EdX: [https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) or, use the course materials separately: [https://cs50.harvard.edu/](https://cs50.harvard.edu)

Alternatively, you can attempt [https://teachyourselfcs.com/](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) where it lists subjects you will encounter over the course of taking a Computer Science degree.

## Building Real World Projects

If you're interested in how real-world software systems are built you can begin to learn about a modern set of libraries and tools you'd need to do that.

### Front-end

This Codecademy course is the closest to the material we've already covered that will show you how modern Front-end apps are built: [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path)\
\
Note: Front-end here, refers to the browser, where we ran all of the code in Fundamentals.

### Back-end

This Codecademy course covers the basics of backend JavaScript servers that you would need to know to work with the internet, requests and handling data, like with the SQL language.
