# Drawing With Emojis

Use loops to create an app that draws emojis into the grey box.

Begin the app by **forking** this repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-drawing](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-drawing)

## Number of Characters

The user will enter a number of characters to display on the screen.

For example, if the user enters 4 they will see this:

## Square

The user will enter the dimensions of a square to display on the screen.

Use a loop within a loop and the `<br>` newline HTML tag in your output to create the square.

For example, if the user enters 4 they will see this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-08-26-at-12.35.12-am.png)

## Triangle

The user will enter the dimensions of a triangle to display on the screen.â€Œ

Use a loop within a loop, a conditional and the `<br>` newline HTML tag in your output to create the triangle.

For example, if the user enters 4 they will see this:

## Modes

Add modes to the program so that the user can create any shape- first the user will enter the shape they want, (this is a shape entering mode), e.g., square, triangle, etc. Then the user will enter the dimensions they want.

## More Comfortable

### Upside down Triangle

The user will enter the dimensions of a triangle to display on the screen.

For example, if the user enters 4 they will see this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-08-26-at-12.36.09-am.png)

### Outline Square

The user will enter the dimensions of a square to display on the screen. The square is outlined by a different character.

For example, if the user enters 4 they will see this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-08-26-at-12.54.56-am.png)

### Center Square

The user will enter the dimensions of a square to display on the screen. The square is outlined by a different character and there is another different character in the center. The app doesn't allow dimensions that will not allow the center character.

For example, if the user enters 5 they will see this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-08-26-at-12.58.34-am.png)

### Rings

The user will enter the dimensions of a square to display on the screen. The characters in the square alternate, creating concentric rings.
