# Project 1: Scissors Paper Stone

## Introduction

For our first project we will make our own version of the classic [Scissors Paper Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) game. We have split this project into 2 parts to cater to the pace of Rocket's Fundamentals course. See the [Course Schedule](../../course-logistics/schedule-and-pairings/) for when we have assigned each part.
